# Hockey Stats Data Automation

This repository contains Google Apps Script files designed to automate the collection of hockey player statistics from two different sources: **Elite Prospects** and the **HockeyTech** network of leagues.

The scripts work in tandem to pull data and populate Google Sheets, making it easy to create and maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date database for hockey analytics.

---

## Features

- **Automated Data Collection**  
  Scripts can be set up with Google Apps Script triggers to run automatically, keeping your data fresh.

- **Two Data Sources**  
  - Pulls player stats from Elite Prospects using the `IMPORTHTML` function for various leagues (OHL, QMJHL, WHL, NCDC, etc.).  
  - Pulls raw JSON data from the HockeyTech API for a wide range of junior leagues (BCHL, SJHL, AJHL, etc.).

- **Robust Data Handling**  
  The `players_StatsUpdate.js` file includes a custom function to fetch, parse, and sanitize JSON data before writing it to a Google Sheet.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Google Sheet**  
   Open a new Google Sheet and create a separate tab for each league you want to track (e.g., `BCHL STATS`, `OHL STATS`).  
   The script will write data to these sheets based on the tab name.

2. **Create an Apps Script Project**  
   Go to Extension < Apps Scripts and start a new project.

3. **Copy the Code**  
   Copy the content of the `.js` files in this repository into your new Apps Script project.  

4. **Set up Triggers**  
   To automate the daily updates, go to the **Triggers** section in your Apps Script project and set up a time-driven trigger for each of the main functions (e.g., `OHLStatsDailyUpdate`, `HockeyTech_Stats_Update`).

## File Breakdown

- **`function_EP_Leagues_DailyUpdate.js`**  
  Contains functions that use `IMPORTHTML` to pull and populate player stats directly from Elite Prospects' league pages into a Google Sheet.

- **`players_StatsUpdate.js`**  
  Includes a `HockeyTech_Stats_Update` function that fetches and processes JSON data from the HockeyTech API, along with a helper function to sanitize the data and write it to a Google Sheet.
